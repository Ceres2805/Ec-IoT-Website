            <p>Want to know how a computer works, or how to design a weird circuit? Well, this is the place for you! </p>
            <p>The Electronics and IoT Club is a community of electronics hobbyists and enthusiasts within IIT Dhanbad.
                 We conduct various events and sessions through out the year to bring out the techie in you. The newly
                  commissioned Tinkerers’ Lab provides an excellent place to experiment and try out new things.</p>

            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>The Electronics Club envisions to nurture your engineering maturity by giving you practical and
                 hands on exposure. We aim to fill in the void of Electronics hobbyists in the institute by
                  providing a platform where the theory learnt in classes can be applied in the real world.</p>
